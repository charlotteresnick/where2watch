# what should i watch
Project 3

Outside sources used: 
Utelly API: https://rapidapi.com/utelly/api/utelly 
Chakra
Color picker
 

Approach:
Are approach towards the project was at first to use the Guidebox API. We needed permission from Guidebox so until then we decided to work on frontend and authenticator until sunday to see if we would hear back from Guidebox. Guidebox did not give us the API so we decided to use Utelly instead which fit are apps purpose but limited are features. 
Once we finished with the basic frontend design and authenticator we had started to mess with movieâ€™s identification from the API and work on the connectivity of the API with the db users. Work on search to make sure functionality was correct before jumping into user interaction, then we decided on which features we would like to add with the user being able to list shows.
